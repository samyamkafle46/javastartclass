String , String Buffers, String Builder

String => sequence of characters bundled up together,
It is a data type which represents a text which includes everything that comes inside the double quotes and it does not represent a numeric data(Int, Double, Float, Big Int, Tiny Int, etc).
Strings are immutable which means you cannot modify it's contents. Also when you want to perform any operations on the string like let's say concatination or substring.
Java creates new string object with the modified content.


String Buffers => it is a java class which represents mutable sequence of characters.
it kinda similar to a string but it provides different methods which let's us to modify the content without creating a new object as done by the String every time.
String buffer is synchronized (it's safe to use in multithreaded environments,etc)


String Builder => basically it is also a java class which represents the mutable sequence of characters similar to the string buffer.
the difference between string buffer and string builder is that string builder is not synchronized.
Since it is not synchronized it makes the string builder more effecient in single threaded environment
